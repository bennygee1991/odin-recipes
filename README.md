# odin-recipes
First project on foundations course of The Odin Project

Hello all, my name is Ben. This is all very exciting and now I will be working on my very first project odin-recipes.

It wont be very pretty but i will have demonstrated the very basics of my skills in HTML and also with GIT and GIT COMMIT. As this project will be revisited later i am excited to keep the different versions of this prjects and the notes throughout on the COMMIT to see how i progress.

Thanks for reading this.
Ben
